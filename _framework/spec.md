# Framework Specification

This is the maximal specification for the Project Orchestration Framework — every directory, every file type, every capability, every rule. Bootstrap a new project via [SETUP.md](../SETUP.md); learn what's needed when from the [adoption guide](adoption-guide.md); reach for this document when you want the full reference.

A lightweight framework for orchestrating multi-area project development with Claude Code agents. Knowledge, code, and data are organized around shared project structures and area-specific structures, with disciplined paths for information to flow between them.

The framework is built around a small always-on foundation plus four togglable capabilities that can be enabled when their cost is justified by the project's signals.

---

## 1. Principles

The framework is built around five ideas, in priority order:

**Specialized areas build toward a shared goal.** A project's work splits across distinct knowledge domains — research, engineering, business model, product. Each area defines its own roles, operates with autonomy within its scope, and contributes back to the commons — the shared ground that holds the project's direction and distilled findings — through a defined promotion protocol. Path-based ownership is the mechanism: every file's location says who owns it.

**Specs precede work; replanning is normal.** Every substantive task — research, code, business model, customer study — starts with a brief and a plan. Phase gates exist so a human can correct course before effort is sunk. When reality diverges from the plan, agents replan via a documented step rather than silently drifting.

**Knowledge compounds; the wiki is the artifact.** The wiki is a persistent compounding artifact, not a transcript of chats. Findings, concepts, and decisions are filed as pages with lifecycle and provenance. The wiki layer (`kb/`) is distinct from the raw layer (`raw/`) — raw materials are immutable; the wiki is what compounds.

**Context loading is intentional.** What an agent loads is decided deliberately, not implicitly. Commons supplies the general background every role needs; frontmatter on each kb page declares relevance hints that guide what else to add. Agents read frontmatter first; full bodies load only when material to the task.

**Discipline scales with need.** A small always-on foundation handles the typical case; togglable capabilities add machinery (POR, subagents, formal review) when projects grow into needing them.

```

**Underscore convention.** A single `_framework/` directory holds all infrastructure. Project content has no underscore prefix (`commons`, `areas`, `roles`, `specs`, `kb`, `raw`, `code`, `data`, `exchanges`). Two exceptions: `_proposed/` inside `commons/` (workflow artifact; "do not write directly") and `_journal/` per area (transient working records; written through skills, not by hand).

**Areas nest.** Sub-specialties (e.g., `areas/research/optics/`) have the same internal shape as parents. Explicit inheritance — role files in the child explicitly reference parent paths in preload lists.

**Raw vs wiki.** Raw materials in `raw/` are immutable; agents read but never modify. The `source` page in `kb/sources/` is the structured summary, with frontmatter `provenance.raw_path` pointing back into `raw/`.

**Raw vs data.** Raw is documents and unstructured material (papers, transcripts, web clips); data is structured datasets with manifests in `data/manifests/`.

**Why `commons`.** The name captures jointly-stewarded shared ground — explicitly the resource the areas pool into and draw from. Direction flows down from commons to areas (brief, POR, mission); distilled findings flow up from areas to commons via the promotion protocol. The plural carries the bidirectional stewardship that a singular "common" couldn't.

### File maintenance categories

- **Human-authored (H)** — hand-edited; agents read but don't write.
- **Agent-maintained (A)** — agents read and write per protocol.
- **Lint-generated (L)** — auto-regenerated from other files; do not hand-edit.

Mapping:

| Path | Category |
|---|---|
| `README.md`, `CLAUDE.md` | H |
| `_framework/**` (schema, tools, skills, hooks, spec.md) | H |
| `_framework/config.yml` | A (managed by `/framework` skill) |
| `commons/brief.md`, `areas/**/brief.md` | H |
| `commons/roles/**/role.md`, `areas/**/roles/**/role.md` | H |
| `exchanges/**/OWNERS`, `exchanges/**/README.md` | H |
| `INBOX.md` | A (agents append; human clears) |
| `commons/POR.md`, `areas/**/POR.md` | A |
| `**/pulse.md` | A |
| `**/_journal/pulse.log` | A |
| `commons/CHANGELOG.md` | A |
| `commons/_proposed/**` | A |
| `commons/kb/**/*.md` (post-promotion) | A |
| `areas/**/kb/**/*.md` | A |
| `areas/**/data/manifests/**` | A |
| `areas/**/specs/**` | A |
| `exchanges/**/q-*.md` | A |
| `**/raw/**` | H (immutable; treated as if human-authored) |
| `areas-index.md` | L |
| `**/kb/index.md` | L |
| `exchanges/**/index.md` | L |
| `**/*.links.json` (backlink sidecars) | L |

Lint enforces category boundaries.

## 3. Capabilities and the `/framework` command

The framework defines a small always-on foundation plus four togglable capabilities. Each capability can be independently enabled or disabled. State lives in `_framework/config.yml`. Changes happen via the `/framework` skill — never by hand-editing config.

### The four capabilities

| Capability | What it adds | Default |
|---|---|---|
| `multi_area` | Pairwise Q&A protocol between areas (the "exchanges" protocol), plus `exchange`, `respond-exchange`, `close-exchange`, `answer-from-kb` skills. | off |
| `por` | Plan of Record files per area and in commons, plus the coordinator role for cross-area planning. POR is loaded into every role's preload list. | off |
| `task_subagents` | Tasks within specs are executed by fresh subagents (clean context, role-loaded). Parent agent plans and orchestrates; subagents implement. | off |
| `formal_review` | Adds rigor on top of subagent execution: independent reviewer subagent after each task, auto-debug subagent on second rejection, and per-area verdict subagents for commons promotions. **Requires `task_subagents`.** | off |

### What's always on (the foundation)

These are not capabilities; they define what the framework is:

- Path-based ownership and the directory layout.
- Frontmatter discipline (the four types: source, concept, finding, decision; their lifecycles).
- CLAUDE.md as the schema document.
- Pulse discipline (per-area `pulse.md` + `_journal/pulse.log`; `wrap-up` compaction).
- Wiki/raw two-layer split.
- Lint correctness rules (always-on errors, see section 14).
- Single-human-gate promotion to commons (the *protection* is always on; `formal_review` adds per-area verdicts on top).
- Specs with phase gates and replanning.
- INBOX for asynchronous human attention; conversation as dominant interaction.

### The `/framework` command

A single skill provides all capability and lint-visibility management.

```
/framework                          show current state of all capabilities
                                    and lint visibility

/framework enable <capability>      enable a capability; prompts for approval,
                                    lists file changes, applies atomically

/framework disable <capability>     disable a capability; warns about content
                                    that becomes inert; applies atomically

/framework enable-lint <rule>       make a disabled lint warning visible

/framework disable-lint <rule>      stop displaying a lint warning
                                    (the rule still runs in shadow mode)

/framework lint-status              show which lint rules are visible vs shadow,
                                    plus recent shadow trigger counts

/framework prune [role]             analyze role file(s) for stale preload
                                    entries; surface candidates for removal
                                    in batched-approval flow
```

The skill's behavior on `enable`:

1. Reads `config.yml`. If already enabled, no-op.
2. Checks dependencies. If `formal_review` requested without `task_subagents`, offers to enable both.
3. Lists proposed file changes in conversation:
   - Files created (e.g., `POR.md` per area when enabling `por`).
   - Files edited (which sections of CLAUDE.md are added, which role files get updated, which skills come online).
4. After user approval (in conversation), applies all changes atomically.
5. Updates `config.yml`.
6. Runs `/check` to confirm clean lint state.

The skill's behavior on `disable`:

1. Identifies content that will become inert (e.g., POR.md files when disabling `por`, exchange files when disabling `multi_area`). Files are **not deleted** — they remain on disk but stop being referenced by role preload lists, schema document sections, and skill behaviors.
2. Warns the user in conversation if substantial content exists.
3. After approval, removes the relevant CLAUDE.md sections, role file entries, and skill conditionals.
4. Updates `config.yml`.
5. Re-enabling later picks up the existing files where they were.

The skill's behavior on `prune`:

1. Reads telemetry data for the targeted role(s) — defaults to all roles if no role specified.
2. For each role, identifies stale preload entries:
   - **Full-tier**: pages not cited or body-loaded in the last `prune.full_tier_stale_sessions` active sessions (default 10).
   - **Frontmatter-tier**: patterns whose matched files yielded no body-loads in the last `prune.frontmatter_tier_stale_sessions` active sessions (default 30). Frontmatter is cheaper to load so the threshold is higher.
   - Pages whose `status` has moved to `superseded`, `dropped`, or `falsified`, regardless of cite history.
3. Surfaces all candidates in conversation with rationale for each.
4. Accepts batched user approval (per-candidate Y/N, or "accept all," or "skip all").
5. Applies approved removals to role files atomically.
6. Runs `/check` to confirm clean lint state.

Pruning never deletes the underlying kb pages — only their entries in role preload lists.

Capability-specific change lists are described declaratively in `_framework/schema/capabilities.md`. The `framework` skill reads this file and applies the described edits. Adding a new capability later means a new section in `capabilities.md` plus a handler in `framework.py`.

### `config.yml` shape

```yaml
# _framework/config.yml

capabilities:
  multi_area: false
  por: false
  task_subagents: false
  formal_review: false

lint:
  # thresholds (apply regardless of warning visibility)
  pulse_line_cap: 80
  stale_concept_threshold_active_days: 30
  promotion_freshness_active_days: 14
  spec_abandonment_active_days: 60
  exchange_stale_active_days: 7
  cross_area_link_threshold: 3
  recent_decisions_window_active_days: 7

  # threshold for suggesting that a shadow rule be enabled
  shadow_suggest_threshold: 5

  # which warning rules are visible
  # disabled = run in shadow; trigger counts surface as suggestions
  warnings_visible:
    rule_4_orphans: false
    rule_8_stale_concept: false
    rule_9_cross_area_links: false
    rule_10_promotion_freshness: false
    rule_11_spec_abandonment: false
    rule_13_backlinker_freshness: false
    rule_14_exchange_staleness: false
    rule_16_cross_area_reads: false

prune:
  # thresholds for /framework prune analysis (in active sessions)
  full_tier_stale_sessions: 10
  frontmatter_tier_stale_sessions: 30
```

Lint, hooks, and skills read from `config.yml` at runtime. Conditional behavior (e.g., does `/implement` spawn a subagent?) checks the relevant capability flag.

---

## 4. The schema document (CLAUDE.md)

CLAUDE.md contains operating principles. It's reshaped by `/framework enable` and `/framework disable` to reflect only currently-enabled capabilities. The current capability set is always visible in `_framework/config.yml`; CLAUDE.md reflects state, not options.

Capability-gated sections are inserted from corresponding files in `_framework/schema/claude-snippets/`. The `framework` skill reads the snippet file and splices it into CLAUDE.md at a marker position (between always-on sections, before "Escalation triggers").

Always-present sections:

```
# Project operating manual

## What this project is
## How knowledge is organized
## How to start a session
## Communicating with the human
## When to write where
## How to interpret types
## Frontmatter discipline
## Loading context
## Links and provenance
## Pulse discipline
## Suggesting preload updates
## Spec lifecycle
## Skills
## Escalation triggers
```

Capability-gated sections (snippet source in `_framework/schema/claude-snippets/`):

```
## Cross-area reads                    (capability: multi_area)
## POR discipline                      (capability: por)
## Subagent pattern                    (capability: task_subagents)
## Formal review                       (capability: formal_review)
```

The "Communicating with the human" section is always present and frames conversation as the dominant interaction mode, with INBOX supplementary for asynchronous attention.

The trim from prior iterations: details on concept stages, type-specific handling, and link mechanics now live in `_framework/schema/frontmatter.md` and `_framework/schema/link-conventions.md`. CLAUDE.md references these but doesn't duplicate them. New procedural sections — "Frontmatter discipline," "Suggesting preload updates," "Pulse discipline" (with log format), and an expanded "Spec lifecycle" (with replan rule of thumb) — replace the trimmed content.

---

## 5. Frontmatter spec

Four types (`source`, `concept`, `finding`, `decision`); status lifecycles per type; type-specific fields; commons-promoted items carry `human_reviewed`, `promoted_from`, `promoted_on`. Source provenance carries `raw_path` pointing into `raw/`. Lint sidecars for backlinks.

See `_framework/schema/frontmatter.md` for the full specification — including the **frontmatter discipline** section that covers when frontmatter gets written or updated, across all creation paths (`/ingest`, `/ask` synthesis, in-conversation idea capture, `/wrap-up` materialization, `/promote`).

### Preload-update suggestion mechanism

When an agent creates or substantively updates a notable page (high-confidence finding, decision, frequently-cited concept), the agent evaluates whether the page should be in some role's preload list. Criteria:

- Type is `finding` with `confidence: high`, OR
- Type is `decision` (active), OR
- Type is `concept` with `status: supported` or actively-cited `under_test`.

If the page qualifies, the agent files an INBOX entry under "Heads up":

> **Preload suggestion**: Consider adding [[<page>]] to `<role-file-path>` (full | frontmatter tier). Reason: <one-line rationale>.

The human reviews and either accepts (agent edits the role file with explicit human confirmation in conversation since role files are human-authored) or declines. Declined suggestions are tracked in `_framework/telemetry/dismissed-suggestions.jsonl` so they're not repeated.

The `/wrap-up` skill scans pages created or updated during the session and files suggestions as a final step before lint.

### Preload pruning

The complementary mechanism. Where the suggestion mechanism handles **additions** (proactively, per-page during work), pruning handles **removals** (cross-session analysis, run on demand).

Pruning identifies candidates from three sources:

- **Stale full-tier entries** — pages in a role's full preload not cited or body-loaded in the last `prune.full_tier_stale_sessions` active sessions (default 10).
- **Stale frontmatter-tier patterns** — patterns whose matched files yielded no body-loads in the last `prune.frontmatter_tier_stale_sessions` active sessions (default 30). Frontmatter is cheaper, so the threshold is higher.
- **Lifecycle-driven removals** — pages whose `status` has moved to `superseded`, `dropped`, or `falsified`, regardless of cite history.

Three paths to act on candidates:

- **Passive surfacing** — `/budget` includes a "Recommended prunes" section in its routine report.
- **Explicit analysis** — `/framework prune [role]` runs the full analysis, surfaces candidates with rationale, and accepts batched approval (per-candidate Y/N, "accept all," or "skip all"). When the user runs prune explicitly, they want a contained back-and-forth.
- **Reactive cleanup** — when a kb page's status transitions to `superseded`/`dropped`/`falsified`, the framework files an INBOX "Heads up" pointing to any role files that reference it.

Pruning never deletes the underlying kb pages — only their entries in role preload lists. Restoring an entry later is a normal role-file edit.

The telemetry data that makes pruning possible — citation tracking and body-load tracking per session — is captured by `_framework/tools/telemetry.py`; see section 18.

---

## 6. Role files

Role files are reshaped by `/framework enable` and `/framework disable` to reflect enabled capabilities. They use a **two-tier preload** structure:

- **Full preload** — small, curated; bodies are loaded into the agent's context.
- **Frontmatter preload** — broad; only frontmatter blocks from matching files are loaded. Specified as directory patterns.

The agent's session-start context is "full preload bodies + frontmatter blocks from files matching the frontmatter preload patterns." Bodies of other pages get loaded on demand when material to the work at hand.

The general shape:

```markdown
---
role: optics-researcher
area: research/optics
summary: Investigates optical-domain questions; designs and runs experiments;
         maintains the optics kb.
---

# Optics Researcher

## Preload context (full)

Schema and conventions:
1. /CLAUDE.md
2. /_framework/schema/frontmatter.md
3. /_framework/schema/link-conventions.md

Project and parent area:
4. /commons/brief.md
5. /commons/pulse.md
6. /commons/POR.md                              # only if capability: por
7. /areas/research/brief.md
8. /areas/research/pulse.md
9. /areas/research/POR.md                       # only if capability: por

Own area:
10. /areas/research/optics/brief.md
11. /areas/research/optics/pulse.md
12. /areas/research/optics/POR.md               # only if capability: por
13. /areas/research/optics/kb/index.md

## Preload context (frontmatter only)

Patterns — frontmatter blocks of all pages under these paths:
- /commons/kb/findings/
- /commons/kb/decisions/
- /areas/research/optics/kb/

Optional individual additions:
- /areas/research/kb/findings/   # parent-area findings

## Operating boundaries

- Writes allowed: /areas/research/optics/** EXCEPT /areas/research/optics/raw/**.
- Raw materials anywhere are read-only; existing files immutable. New raw materials added through /ingest.
- Writes to /commons/: forbidden; use /propose-promotion.
- Writes to other areas: forbidden.
- Reads allowed: full repo, but prefer /exchange (when available) over deep reads into other areas' kb bodies.

## Allowed skills

(set varies by enabled capabilities — see section 15)

## Default behaviors

- Cite using [[wikilinks]].
- When citing a concept, surface its status.
- When ending a session, run /wrap-up before clearing.
- When a task's plan looks wrong, invoke /replan; do not improvise.
- When you create or substantively update a notable page, file an INBOX "Heads up" preload suggestion if appropriate.
- Ask the human in conversation when uncertain. INBOX is for items the human will see later, not a substitute for asking now.
```

The `start` skill, when loading a role, processes the frontmatter preload patterns: for each pattern, recursively find all `.md` files in matching directories; extract only the frontmatter block (content between the leading and closing `---`); append each block to the agent's context with the file path as reference.

A **reviewer role** is a stripped-down variant of the implementer role. Same preload (both tiers); operating boundaries restricted to verdict files; allowed skills limited to `review`. Reviewer roles only exist when `formal_review` is enabled.

The **coordinator role** at `commons/roles/coordinator/role.md` exists only when `por` is enabled. Read-broad, write-narrow:
- **Full preload**: `CLAUDE.md`, schema files, `commons/brief.md`, `commons/POR.md`, `commons/pulse.md`, `areas-index.md`, `INBOX.md`, all area `POR.md` and `pulse.md` files.
- **Frontmatter preload**: all area `kb/` directories.
- **Writes**: `INBOX.md`, `commons/POR.md`, specs across areas. Cannot write area kb or commons kb.

See `_framework/schema/role-template.md` for the canonical template and `_framework/schema/index-format.md` for the `kb/index.md` format that the frontmatter preload complements.

---

## 7. Session start and role routing

SessionStart hook loads `CLAUDE.md`, `areas-index.md`, `INBOX.md`. The `start` skill handles routing — identifies area and role, loads preload list, or asks for clarification.

When `coordinator` role is unavailable (i.e., `por` is off), cross-area requests prompt the human in conversation to pick an area rather than auto-adopting a coordinator role.

Explicit invocation: `/start <role> <request>` skips the routing and adopts the named role directly.

The `start` skill recognizes three patterns for in-request routing beyond the default content-based inference: (1) **inline area or role mentions** ("…in engineering", "as a researcher…") parsed and used directly without further prompting; (2) **mid-session switch language** ("switch to engineering", "now work as product-manager") that reloads the named role's preload list; and (3) **read-only cross-area queries** ("what's in engineering's pulse?") that keep the current role active and read the requested content without switching. Role switches happen only when the work would require writes outside the current role's boundaries.

**areas-index.md** is auto-maintained by lint. Format:

```markdown
# Areas Index
_Auto-maintained by lint; do not edit by hand._
_Last updated: 2026-05-08_

## commons/
Project-wide knowledge, code, and data. Use exchanges or area work,
not direct commons writes.

Roles:
- coordinator — cross-area planning, INBOX management, POR updates
  (only present when capability: por is enabled)

## areas/research/
[summary from areas/research/brief.md]

Roles:
- researcher — broad research questions

### areas/research/optics/
[summary from areas/research/optics/brief.md]

Roles:
- optics-researcher — optical-domain investigations
```

### Adding a new area or sub-area

The `/add-area <path>` skill walks the human through area creation. The path syntax handles both top-level areas (`/add-area engineering`) and sub-areas (`/add-area research/optics`). The skill:

1. Verifies the parent path exists and the target doesn't.
2. Asks the user (in conversation): brief description of the area's focus.
3. Creates the directory structure (`kb/`, `raw/`, `data/`, `specs/`, `roles/`, `_journal/`).
4. Writes `brief.md` (from user response), initial `pulse.md` template, empty `_journal/pulse.log`, empty `kb/index.md`.
5. Asks: what role(s) should this area have? Suggests defaults based on the parent area (e.g., for `research/optics`, suggest `optics-researcher`).
6. For each role, prompts the user to confirm or adjust the preload list (both tiers); creates the role file using `_framework/schema/role-template.md`.
7. Checks parent-area role files: if the parent has roles whose preload patterns should now reference the new sub-area, surfaces suggestions in conversation. Applies updates after human confirmation.
8. Runs lint to regenerate `areas-index.md` and confirm clean state.
9. Commits the new area.

If `por` is enabled, the skill also offers to create a stub `POR.md` for the new area.

---

## 8. POR (Plan of Record) — capability: `por`

When `por` is enabled, every area (and commons) has a `POR.md` file alongside `brief.md`. The three files complement each other:

- **brief.md** — why this exists. Changes rarely. Always present.
- **POR.md** — current plan and execution state. Updated when phases shift, workstreams change, or replans happen. Present only when `por` is enabled.
- **pulse.md** — what's current. Changes constantly. Always present.

POR content includes current phase, active workstreams, upcoming, dependencies, and status/risks.

The `wrap-up` skill prompts the user in conversation to confirm POR updates when relevant events occurred during the session.

The `coordinator` role exists when `por` is enabled and updates `commons/POR.md`. Area roles update their own area's POR.

**On disable.** Existing POR files remain on disk. Role preload lists are updated to remove POR references; CLAUDE.md's POR section is removed; the coordinator role file is removed from `commons/roles/`. Re-enabling later picks up the existing files where they were.

---

## 9. INBOX

`INBOX.md` at the project root collects items that need the human's attention asynchronously. Three sections (Needs decision, Awaiting your ack, Heads up). Agents append; human clears. Conversation remains the dominant interaction mode; INBOX is supplementary.

```markdown
# Inbox
_Last touched by agents: 2026-05-08 14:22_

## Needs decision
(blocked on you; agents cannot proceed)

- [2026-05-07] Objection on proposed promotion
  `commons/_proposed/2026-05-07-noise-finding/`. Engineering objects to scope;
  research approves. Verdict files in proposal dir.

- [2026-05-06] Spec `specs/2026-05-1f-noise` brief drafted in
  areas/research/optics/; awaiting your approval before plan phase.

## Awaiting your ack
(done, just needs your eyes)

- [2026-05-08] Promoted to commons: [[findings/f-2026-05-shot-noise]]
  (human_reviewed: false).

## Heads up
(FYI; you don't need to act, but you should know)

- [2026-05-08] 5 customer interview transcripts in `areas/product/raw/interviews/`
  not yet ingested.
- [2026-05-08] Exchange `engineering--research/q-2026-05-04-thermal` open
  for 4 active days without response.
```

## 10. Spec template

Every substantive task lives in a spec directory under `<area>/specs/<date>-<slug>/`:

```
specs/2026-05-photodetector-noise/
├── brief.md         # what we're doing and why; one screen
├── plan.md          # method, architecture, or approach
├── tasks.md         # discrete steps with _Boundary:_ and _Depends:_
├── revisions.md     # append-only log of replans
└── outcome.md       # what happened; produced pages; superseded plans
```

Per-task annotations:

```markdown
### T1: Set up the noise-floor measurement rig
_Boundary:_ /areas/research/optics/code/measurement-rig/
_Depends:_ —
_Status:_ planned
_Owner role:_ optics-researcher

[task description]

#### Implementation Notes
(Appended by subagents as they work; persists across sessions.)
```

Phase gates: brief → [human approves in conversation] → plan → [human approves] → tasks → execution → outcome → [human approves close]. `/replan` can fire from any point; appends to `revisions.md`; updates plan and/or tasks.

When `task_subagents` is off, `/implement` runs the work in the current agent. When on, each task spawns a fresh subagent.

---

## 11. Pulse mechanics

Each area, sub-area, and commons maintains a pair of files:

**pulse.md** — canonical current state, bounded. Maximum size enforced by lint (default 80 lines). Sections:

```markdown
# Research/Optics — pulse
_Last compaction: 2026-05-08 14:30_

## Current focus
(2–4 lines, rewritten not appended)

## Recent decisions (last 7 active days)
- [[decisions/d-2026-05-04-bias-current]] — bias at 1 mA, not 5 mA
- ...

## Active concepts under test
- [[concepts/c-2026-04-shot-noise]] — status: under_test
- ...

## Open questions
- Does 1/f noise floor depend on bias direction?
- ...

## Recent findings (last 5)
- [[findings/f-2026-05-shot-noise]]
- ...
```

**_journal/pulse.log** — append-only event log. Entries during the session:

```markdown
## [2026-05-08 09:14] decision optics-researcher
Adopted bias current of 1 mA per measurement constraints.
→ to be filed: decisions/d-2026-05-04-bias-current

## [2026-05-08 11:22] finding optics-researcher
Shot noise floor measured at 1310nm; matches theory within 8%.
→ to be filed: findings/f-2026-05-shot-noise

## [2026-05-08 13:45] focus-shift optics-researcher
Switching from noise-floor characterization to 1/f investigation per replan
in spec ...
```

The `_journal/` subdirectory holds transient working records — currently just `pulse.log`, but a natural home for any future append-only artifacts (debug traces, session histories) that agents produce during work and that get compacted or truncated later.

**Compaction (the `wrap-up` skill)**:

1. Read `_journal/pulse.log` and `pulse.md`.
2. For each log entry, decide:
   - **decision**: ensure a `decisions/` page exists; reference in "Recent decisions"; drop entries past activity-day threshold.
   - **finding**: ensure a `findings/` page exists; keep 5 most recent in pulse.
   - **concept**: update "Active concepts under test" with status changes.
   - **question**: add to "Open questions" if novel; remove when resolved.
   - **focus-shift**: rewrite "Current focus."
3. Verify `pulse.md` fits the line cap. If not, promote oldest items to kb or drop — never silent truncation.
4. If POR-affecting events occurred and `por` is enabled, prompt the user in conversation to confirm POR updates and apply them.
5. Truncate `_journal/pulse.log`.
6. Run lint.
7. Commit (optional; on by default).

**Compaction triggers**:
- Manual: `/wrap-up` invoked by user before session end or context clear.
- Hooks: `PreCompact` and `SessionEnd` invoke wrap-up as safety net.

A session that ends without `/wrap-up` and without hooks firing leaves a stale log. Next session's first read of pulse should detect a non-empty log and either compact first or surface a warning.

---

## 12. Exchange protocol — capability: `multi_area`

Exchanges are how agents in one area get authoritative answers from another area without deep-reading the other area's kb.

**Filing.** Asker in area X invokes `/exchange <other-area> <question>`. Skill:

1. If `exchanges/<a>--<b>/` doesn't exist, creates it with `OWNERS`, `README.md`, `index.md`.
2. Creates `q-<date>-<slug>.md`:

```yaml
---
id: ex-2026-05-08-thermal-sensitivity
status: open                  # open | answered | follow_up | closed
asker_area: engineering
asker_role: hardware-engineer
responder_area: research
created: 2026-05-08
relevant_to: [thermal budget, detector responsivity]
---

# Question
What's the temperature dependence of responsivity for the 1310 nm
photodetector?

## Context
[[concepts/c-2026-04-shot-noise]]; spec [[specs/2026-05-detector-thermal/brief]]

# Response
(filled in by responder)

# Follow-up
(optional; asker can drill in)
```

3. Appends an entry to `exchanges/<a>--<b>/index.md`.

**Responding.** When work in the responder area happens, the responder invokes `/respond-exchange <id>`. If `task_subagents` is on, the responder spawns a subagent with the responder area's role context, restricted to writing the Response section. Subagent may use `/answer-from-kb` to pull existing kb pages by reference. On completion, status flips to `answered`.

**Reviewing the answer.** Asker reviews. If sufficient, `/close-exchange <id>` flips status to `closed`. If not, asker edits the Follow-up section and flips status to `follow_up`; the cycle repeats.

**Staleness.** Lint flags exchanges with `status: open` aged past the activity-day threshold; entries surface to INBOX under "Heads up."

**On disable.** Existing exchange directories remain. Skills become unavailable; CLAUDE.md's "Cross-area reads" section is removed. Re-enabling picks up existing exchanges.

---

## 13. Link conventions

Within `kb/` directories, agents use Obsidian-style `[[wikilinks]]`. For files outside `kb/` (code, manifests, specs, raw materials), agents use relative markdown links with explicit paths.

**Forward links** are written by the authoring agent. **Backlinks** are maintained by the linter via sidecar `<page>.links.json` files. The author never edits the sidecar.

**Linking to superseded pages is an error.** The linter suggests the replacement via `superseded_by`.

**Cross-area links are valid but watched.** Lint warns when a single page accumulates links to multiple distinct areas (default 3+). Pages with `area: commons` are exempt.

**Bidirectional content consistency** requires both lint and convention:

- **Lint (Rule 13)**: flag pages whose `links_out` point to pages updated more recently than the page itself. Output goes to INBOX or `/check` summary.
- **Convention** (in CLAUDE.md): after substantively updating a page, agents check the page's backlinks. For each backlinker, the agent decides whether the update affects what the backlinker asserts. If yes, the agent updates the backlinker inline (preferred) or files an INBOX "Heads up" entry.

---

## 14. Lint rules

The linter (`_framework/tools/lint.py`) is deterministic Python. It runs on demand via `/check` and at the end of every `/wrap-up`.

**All rules always run.** What changes per configuration is whether findings are *visible* (displayed and acted on) or *shadowed* (counted internally; surfaced as suggestions when frequent).

**Always-visible rules** (errors and structural correctness):

```
Rule 1.  Frontmatter validity.
Rule 2.  Forward-link integrity (including provenance.raw_path).
Rule 3.  Backlink synchronization.
Rule 5.  Supersession integrity.
Rule 6.  Type-specific completeness.
Rule 7.  Pulse size (pulse.md exceeding line cap is an error).
Rule 12. Data manifest integrity.
Rule 15. Index maintenance (regenerate areas-index.md, kb/index.md).
Rule 17. Raw immutability (modifications to existing files in raw/ — additions are allowed).
Rule 18. Maintenance category violations.
```

**Configurable-visibility rules** (warnings):

```
Rule 4.  Orphan detection.
Rule 8.  Stale concept warning (concept: under_test > 30 active days).
Rule 9.  Cross-area link threshold (>= N areas; commons pages exempt).
Rule 10. Promotion freshness (human_reviewed: false > 14 active days).
Rule 11. Spec hygiene (tasks non-terminal > 60 active days).
Rule 13. Backlinker freshness.
Rule 14. Exchange staleness (status: open > 7 active days, if multi_area on).
Rule 16. Cross-area read pattern.
```

**Shadow run behavior.** When a rule is shadowed, the linter still evaluates it but doesn't display findings in the standard report. Instead, the linter accumulates trigger counts and adds a suggestion section at the bottom of the report:

```
Disabled lint rules with significant findings:
  Rule 4 (orphans) — 12 findings
  Rule 11 (spec abandonment) — 3 findings

Consider enabling: /framework enable-lint rule_4
```

A rule's findings surface as a suggestion when the trigger count meets `shadow_suggest_threshold` (default 5).

**Activity-based thresholds.** All time thresholds use git-log-derived active days, computed via `_framework/tools/activity_days.py`.

**Capability-conditional rules.** Rule 14 (exchange staleness) only runs when `multi_area` is enabled.

The linter is the trust anchor. No LLM in the loop.

---

## 15. Skills

Each skill is a Claude Code Agent Skill with a `SKILL.md`. Skills can be invoked explicitly by slash command or autonomously when context matches the skill's trigger conditions.

**Always available:**

| Skill | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `framework` | Manage capabilities and lint visibility. |
| `start` | Route a fresh session: identify area, suggest role, load preload list. |
| `ingest` | Store raw material in `raw/`; create source summary in `kb/sources/` with provenance; link to concepts. |
| `ask` | Query the wiki; synthesize an answer; optionally file as kb page. |
| `plan` | Bootstrap a spec: brief → plan → tasks (human gates in conversation). |
| `implement` | Execute one task. Behavior depends on `task_subagents`. |
| `replan` | Append revision entry; update plan and tasks; require human approval. |
| `propose-promotion` | Copy area page to `commons/_proposed/`; generate proposal; register in INBOX. |
| `promote` | Apply promotion after consensus or human override; write CHANGELOG entry. Behavior depends on `formal_review`. |
| `wrap-up` | Compact `_journal/pulse.log` → `pulse.md`; file pending pages; prompt POR updates (if `por` on); run lint. |
| `check` | Run lint; display findings; surface shadow-rule suggestions. |
| `budget` | Report estimated context cost of role preloads and recent session telemetry; identify heavy paths and pruning candidates. |
| `add-area` | Walk the human through creating a new area or sub-area: directory structure, brief, pulse template, roles, and any parent-area role file updates. |

**Capability-gated:**

| Skill | Available when |
|---|---|
| `exchange` | `multi_area` on |
| `respond-exchange` | `multi_area` on |
| `close-exchange` | `multi_area` on |
| `answer-from-kb` | `multi_area` on |
| `review` | `formal_review` on |
| `review-promotion` | `formal_review` on |

---

## 16. Promotion-review protocol

The always-on protection: any change to `commons/` goes through `commons/_proposed/` first, with a human gate before promotion.

**Without `formal_review`.** Filing happens via `/propose-promotion`. The human reads the proposal (often in conversation, or via INBOX). The human approves or rejects. On approval, `/promote` applies the change.

**With `formal_review`.** After filing, `/review-promotion` spawns a subagent in each other area's reviewer role. Each subagent writes `verdict-<area>.md` with `APPROVE | OBJECT | ABSTAIN` plus rationale. Consensus rules apply: all non-abstain APPROVE → auto-promote; any OBJECT → human escalation; all ABSTAIN → human decides. The human still acks (`human_reviewed: true`) after promotion.

In both cases, audit trail (`_proposed/` directory, verdict files when applicable) is kept after promotion.

---

## 17. Subagent pattern — capability: `task_subagents`

When `task_subagents` is enabled, `/implement` spawns a fresh subagent for each task. The subagent's context is loaded from the role's preload list — it does not see the parent's working context.

**Without `formal_review`.** The subagent executes the task. The parent agent (or the human) reviews the output in conversation. No reviewer subagent.

**With `formal_review`.** After the subagent completes, `/review` spawns a reviewer subagent in a reviewer role variant. The reviewer reads the output against the spec and writes a verdict. On rejection, parent may re-invoke `/implement` with rejection notes (retry limit default 2). On second rejection, an auto-debug subagent loads in clean context to investigate root causes.

Subagents don't parallelize automatically, don't carry state between invocations except via files, and don't override role boundaries.

**On disable.** `/implement` switches back to running in the current agent. No content loss.

---

## 18. Token instrumentation and budget tracking

The framework tracks per-session context cost so role preloads can be tuned and heavy paths identified. The mechanism is approximate but stable enough for comparison and pruning decisions.

### What Claude Code provides natively

Two interactive slash commands give exact, real-time visibility:

- **`/context`** — breaks down current context usage by category (system prompt, system tools, MCP tools, custom agents, memory files, skills, messages, free space, autocompact buffer) within Claude Code's 200k token window.
- **`/usage`** (aliases `/cost`, `/stats`) — session cost, plan usage limits, activity stats.

These are the source of truth at any given moment. The framework's job is to make preload costs **predictable** ahead of time and to surface trends across sessions.

### Framework instrumentation

**`_framework/tools/token_estimate.py`** estimates the token cost of a role's preload list (full bodies + frontmatter blocks from matching patterns) using a tokenizer compatible with Claude's model. The estimate is approximate but consistent enough for relative comparison across roles and over time.

**`_framework/tools/telemetry.py`** writes a per-session entry to `_framework/telemetry/sessions.jsonl`. The SessionStart hook records the preload estimate; the session-end hook (or `/wrap-up`) records what happened during the session. Each entry:

```json
{
  "timestamp": "2026-05-08T09:14:00Z",
  "session_id": "2026-05-08-am-optics",
  "role": "optics-researcher",
  "area": "research/optics",
  "full_preload_files": 13,
  "full_preload_tokens_est": 8450,
  "frontmatter_preload_files": 47,
  "frontmatter_preload_tokens_est": 3200,
  "total_preload_tokens_est": 11650,
  "pages_cited": [
    "areas/research/optics/kb/findings/f-2026-05-shot-noise.md",
    "areas/research/optics/kb/sources/s-2026-04-saleh-teich-ch17.md"
  ],
  "bodies_loaded_beyond_preload": [
    "areas/research/optics/kb/concepts/c-2026-04-1f-noise-bias.md"
  ]
}
```

The `pages_cited` list is populated by scanning agent outputs for `[[wikilink]]` references. The `bodies_loaded_beyond_preload` list comes from tracking file-read tool invocations during the session — files in the preload don't count (they were always going to be loaded); files read in service of the work do.

The telemetry directory is git-ignored — entries are local to each clone.

### The `/budget` skill

Reports recent session telemetry and identifies pruning candidates:

- **Preload cost** — per-role average over the last N sessions, with 95th-percentile high-water mark.
- **Heaviest full-tier files** — candidates for moving to frontmatter tier or dropping.
- **Frontmatter patterns that match many files but rarely yield body-loads** — candidates for narrowing.
- **Recommended prunes** — pages stale per the prune thresholds (see section 5), filterable by role. Same data feeds `/framework prune` for the explicit-approval flow.
- **Budget comparison** — if a per-role `budget_tokens_est` is set in the role file's frontmatter, sessions exceeding it surface here.

The skill produces a brief report; the human decides whether to revise role files (manually or via `/framework prune`).

### Per-role budget targets

Optionally, role files can declare a budget target in frontmatter:

```yaml
---
role: optics-researcher
area: research/optics
summary: ...
budget_tokens_est: 12000
---
```

When set, `/budget` and `/check` flag sessions where estimated preload exceeded the target by a configurable margin.

### Subagent budgets

When `task_subagents` is enabled, each subagent invocation gets its own telemetry entry. Subagents typically use the same role's preload, so cost-per-task is predictable. The `/budget` skill aggregates subagent invocations separately from parent agent sessions.

---

## 19. Raw materials and data manifests

Raw materials in `raw/` are immutable; source pages in `kb/sources/` summarize them with `provenance.raw_path` pointing to the raw file. Data manifests in `data/manifests/` describe datasets; structured input data lives in `data/`.

Manifest example:

```markdown
---

# Description
(Prose context — what's in the data, gotchas, known issues.)
```

Manifests link bidirectionally with kb. Lint enforces both directions.

---

## 20. What's deferred

- Multi-user collaboration.
- Search beyond `index.md`.
- CI integration (lint in CI).
- Web search ingest.
- Cross-spec contradiction review.

---

## 21. Bootstrap path

1. Create the template repo with `_framework/` populated, plus empty `commons/` and `areas/` skeletons. Write `CLAUDE.md` (always-on sections only), `_framework/config.yml` with initial state (all four capabilities off; all warnings shadowed).

2. Write `lint.py`, `pulse_compact.py`, `promote.py`, `framework.py`, `activity_days.py`, `token_estimate.py`, and `telemetry.py` as deterministic Python.

3. Write the always-available skills as `_framework/skills/<name>/SKILL.md` with explicit trigger language. Write the capability-gated skills too — all skills ship with the template; the `framework` skill manages activation state via `config.yml`.

4. Write `_framework/schema/capabilities.md` and the four snippet files in `_framework/schema/claude-snippets/` (one per capability) declaratively describing what each enable/disable operation does.

5. Pick one project to instantiate. Write `commons/brief.md`. Pick 2 areas to start. Write area `brief.md` and one role per area.

6. **Pre-created at setup**: `INBOX.md` (empty), `areas-index.md` (lint populates), `roles/<role>/role.md` per area, `raw/` per area (empty subdirs), `kb/` per area (empty subdirs), `pulse.md` per area (empty template), `_journal/pulse.log` per area (empty). **On-demand**: exchanges (`/exchange` bootstraps), specs (`/plan` bootstraps), `_proposed/` entries (`/propose-promotion` bootstraps), POR files (when `/framework enable por` runs).

7. Run one end-to-end exercise: ingest 2–3 sources, run one spec brief → outcome, propose a finding to commons, promote it.

8. As the project grows, enable capabilities as signals appear. The framework skill handles all the mechanics.

---

## 22. Open questions

**Pulse line cap.** Default 80 lines. Reasonable across areas, or do some areas need different caps?

**Auto-debug retry limit.** Default 2 rejections before auto-debug fires (applies when `formal_review` on).

**Cross-area specs.** Default: spec lives under the area that owns the outcome; coordination via exchanges. Alternative: top-level `cross-area-specs/`. I'd avoid the alternative unless we find we need it.

**Sub-area POR.** Default: include but allow it to be a stub or omitted with a parent-POR note.

**Manifest type.** Marked `type: source`. Could add `type: data` if friction emerges.

**Raw subdirectory structure.** Suggested `papers/`, `articles/`, `transcripts/`, `web/`. Areas can add subdirs as needed; framework doesn't constrain.

**Shadow trigger threshold.** Default 5 findings before suggesting enable. Tunable in `config.yml`.
